- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @traiyn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sustainable engineering of data ecosystems. More intimately, I enjoy riding my bike, weightlifting, choral singing, D&D and PF2e, sports (soccer, tennis, volleyball), TFT, and spending time with my fiance and our dog.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be a better Python developer, a more curious SQL monkey, and dabbling in some new stuff tech/tools for my own edification, including: Spark, AirFlow, Azure (data engineer cert), dbt.
